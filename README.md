## Introduction
This project is based around a chess club website and is designed to reinforce knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3.
If we only count the work I do while I'm at school, I work on this project every Monday for a total of 3 hours.

## Functionalities

- Opening times for adults and children
- Map showing the location of the club
